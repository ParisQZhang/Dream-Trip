# What is DreamTrip

DreamTrip is a ReactJS app built for planning trips and building iteneraries, the main features are place recommendations and visualization of locations on Google Map for easy itinerary planning.

This Project was originally bult by myself (Paris Zhang ([Github](https://github.com/ParisQZhang) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paris-qing-zhang/))).

Three other developers took this project further by adding authentication, drag and drop, and email functionalities as well as testing, these extra functionalities are also included in this README file. The working repository for their project is [amantoniazzi/Dream-Trip](https://github.com/amantoniazzi/Dream-Trip), and the three developers are listed below:

# Getting Started

The app runs on a React front end using Google Maps Javascript API and the Google Places API to render maps and coordinates. The backend runs on express. The first thing you'll need to get started is a Google API Key.

## Google API Key

The App uses Google's places API. You'll need to get a key to have the app running.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/home) and set up a new project by clicking on **Select a project** _(Right next where it says Google Cloud Platform )_.
2. Navigate to the project itself (you should be able to do this from the projects dashboard), and then hover over **APIs & Services** and click on **Credentials**
3. Now use the **Create Credentials** button to create an **API Key**.
4. Set up your environment variables in both the **client** and **server**. In the client, create a `.env` file and copy in the information in `.env.example`. Set `REACT_APP_API_KEY` to the API key you just got from Google. In the server file create a `.env file`, copy in the details from `.env.example` and set the `SECRET_API_KEY` as the API key you just got from Google.

## Start the backend

1. Install the dependencies by running the following while in the **server** folder
<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
2. Start the server with
   <pre><code>node index.js</code></pre>
   You should see the following in the terminal to show that the **server** is up and running
   <pre><code>Server is listening at http://localhost:3079 ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
   ðŸ¦† Database (JWT) connected @ port 27017!</code></pre>

## Start the front end

1. Install the dependencies by running the following while in the **client** folder
<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
2. Start the front end with
   <pre><code>npm start</code></pre>
   The app should open in your browser at localhost:3000 (The default React PORT)
